# Generic Parser for XML and JSON

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust and flexible parser for XML and JSON data formats, focusing on integration with RESTful APIs. The parser should remove dependencies on specific technologies and allow for the deserialization and storage of incoming JSON data in relevant databases. The objective is to create a parser that can handle various data structures, nesting levels, and schema specifications, providing error handling, validation, flexibility, and customization options.

## Description

### Features

- **Support for XML and JSON**: The parser should support parsing data in both XML and JSON formats, accommodating various data structures and nesting levels.
- **Error Handling and Validation**: Mechanisms for error detection, handling, and validation should be included to ensure data integrity and reliability.
- **Flexibility and Customization**: The parser should offer flexibility and customization options, allowing users to configure parsing rules, handle special cases, and integrate with existing systems. Users should be able to choose fields to parse.
- **Mapping JSON structure to final tables**: Ability to map the JSON structure to final database tables.
- **Nested Data Handling**: Ability to handle up to 3 levels of nesting in the data.
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle a high volume of calls, targeting 50K calls per hour.
- **Modularity and Extensibility**: Code design should be modular and extensible using standard design patterns, facilitating future enhancements and integrations.

### Tech Stack

Open to all technologies that support the required functionality.

## Submission Format / Deliverables

- **Parser API**: Fully functional parser API hosted on a freeware server like Vercel.
- **Meta Data Definition**: Meta data definition in the form of a simple input/output mapping file.
- **Source Code Files**: Source code of the parser.
- **DDL Script**: DDL script of the output table generated by the code.
- **API Document**: Documentation of the API, including limitations.
- **Documentation**: Architecture design, database diagrams, and any additional documentation.
- **Presentation/Demo**: Showcase the solution.
- **References**: Links to references used, if applicable.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Parsing and storage of sample JSONs provided by DMI.
- Speed of execution.
- Code design and modularity.
- Database design and constraints.
